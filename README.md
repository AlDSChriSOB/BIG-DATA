# BIG-DATA
his script focuses on initial data exploration of UK road casualty data from the year 2019.

1. Library Imports

The code imports necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization:
pandas (pd) for data analysis (loading CSV files, data cleaning, manipulation).
numpy (np) for numerical operations.
seaborn (sns) for creating statistical graphics (potentially for data exploration and visualization).
matplotlib.pyplot (plt) for creating plots (potentially for data exploration and visualization).
pandas_profiling is commented out (#import pandas_profiling as pp). This library could be used for generating a more comprehensive report on the data's characteristics.
2. Loading Accident Data

pd.read_csv is used to read the CSV file named "dft-road-casualty-statistics-accident-2019.csv" into a pandas DataFrame named accident. This DataFrame likely contains information about road accidents in the UK for 2019.

The script then simply prints accident to potentially display a glimpse of the DataFrame's contents (first few rows and columns).

3. Loading Casualty Data

Similarly, pd.read_csv is used to read another CSV file named "dft-road-casualty-statistics-casualty-2019.csv" into a DataFrame named casualty. This data likely contains information about casualties (injuries or fatalities) related to road accidents.

The script again prints casualty to potentially show the initial contents of the DataFrame.

4. Loading Vehicle Data

Following the same pattern, pd.read_csv reads the "dft-road-casualty-statistics-vehicle-2019.csv" file into a DataFrame named vehicle. This data likely contains details about vehicles involved in the road accidents.

The script prints vehicle to potentially display the initial contents of the DataFrame.

5. Next Steps (to be explored based on availability of code cells)

The provided code snippets only show the initial data loading phase. You might encounter other code cells in the project that handle further exploration and analysis:

Data Cleaning: Inspecting and cleaning the data for missing values, inconsistencies, or outliers.
Data Exploration: Analyzing data characteristics, identifying patterns, and understanding relationships between variables. Techniques like descriptive statistics, data visualization (histograms, box plots, scatter plots) can be used.
Data Merging: If applicable, the script might merge the separate DataFrames (accident, casualty, vehicle) based on appropriate keys to create a comprehensive dataset for further analysis. This would allow combining information about accidents, casualties, and vehicles involved.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data (e.g., severity scores based on casualty types) might be done to enhance analysis.
Data Visualization: Creating various plots and charts to visualize data distributions, relationships between variables, and identify trends related to road casualties.
By exploring the data further and potentially merging the separate DataFrames, you can gain valuable insights into UK road casualty statistics for 2019. This initial exploration helps prepare the data for further analysis tasks.
